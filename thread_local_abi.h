 * The initial thread-local ABI shared structure is associated with
 * the tlabi_nr parameter value 0 passed to the thread_local_abi system
 * call. It will be henceforth referred to as "tlabi 0".
 *
 * This tlabi 0 structure should ideally be aligned on the L1 cache line
 * size, which is approximated to 64 bytes, but strictly requires to be
 * aligned at least on the architecture pointer size. This accomodate
 * linkers which can have a hard time guaranteeing alignment of
 * variables. The tlabi 0 structure has a fixed length of 64 bytes. Each
 * of its fields should be naturally aligned so no padding is necessary.
 *
 * The size of tlabi 0 structure is fixed to 64 bytes to ensure that
 * neither the kernel nor user-space have to perform size checks. The
 * choice of 64 bytes matches the L1 cache size on common architectures.
 *
 * If more fields are needed than the available 64 bytes, a new
 * thread-local ABI tlabi number should be reserved, associated to its
 * own shared structure layout.
